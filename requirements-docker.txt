# Obelisk Agent – Docker (Slim) Requirements
# ~300-400MB image vs ~2.5GB with full ML stack
#
# This file is for the Docker agent container that runs workflows.
# Inference is handled by the standalone inference service (not in this container),
# so torch, transformers, peft, accelerate, bitsandbytes are NOT needed here.
